# GameDevJam - Mind Shifter
My first game jam... 

The main idea: You control the npc that kills you. Nothing stays dead for long.

For those who want to learn from my source code, just don't... It is a mess, I don't think it would be any help, honestly. For those who are going to evaluate my code, this game is created in a very very short period of time and I am not really good at clean code right now. I will get better, hopefully...
